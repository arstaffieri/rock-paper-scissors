#### Learning Goals:
Write clean, DRY JavaScript Explore the connections between HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

#### Wins + Challenges:
I am very proud of how my game logic works. I wrote it out and it worked on the first try. My biggest challenge was in figuring out what elements to show and hide when. I had to write down what I needed to happen each time the user clicked because it was a lot to remember.
